# Chapter 2: Prepare Data

# Prepare data

#Transform data into usable datasets
- develop data structures
-  design a data sampling strategy
-  design the data preparation flow

#Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Review visual analytics data to discover patterns and determine next steps
    identify anomalies, outliers, and other data inconsistencies
- Create descriptive statistics for a dataset

#Cleanse and transform data
 
- Resolve anomalies, outliers, and other data inconsistencies.
- Standardize data formats
- Set the granularity for data

# Prepare Data

Data does not usually come in a format ready for running a machine-learninf algorithm,
Why? because algorithms need a big data frame to work, that is tabublar data your algorithm can use.

So, the first task for us is to make data available aas a bit table.
If we're lucky that information will be held in a databse, and some data will look like a table without much work.
IProbablt we can get that table information joining some tables we've got access to.

In Azure we can prepare data
